I'm a CS major currently based in Cambridge Massachusetts

I like to build whatever I can imagine ✨

I'm learning about AWS systems so I'm currently working on a AI Call Assistant Project using AWS, Langchain and Docker!

Since I love to travel, I built a Machine Learning project to do predictions on Airbnb Prices.

I started coding and have been building programs since 3 years ago but I haven't been updating my github a lot so I want to start doing more documentation of my projects's progresses here!

💬 How to reach me: hmanh1601@gmail.com

  - My favourite book: The Midnight Library
